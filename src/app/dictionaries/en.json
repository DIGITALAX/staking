From those first digital garments on Ethereum, to one of the earliest protocol moves onto L2s, and somewhere in the middle of the acceleration, a midnight Web3 runway in New York City.<br /><br />Chaos and commits, chaos and commits. Code and infra, and infra and code. Code to reinforce decentralisation and user agency. To refashion an entire industry back to first principles: manufacturing, programmable instruments, financial primitives.<br /><br />No need to restate the details. You were there.<br /><br />Time for V3. A <a href=\"https://genesis.digitalax.xyz/\" class=\"underline cursor-pointer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Lens mint</a> carries it all forward into Matroid staking.
